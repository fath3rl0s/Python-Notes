These are personal notes on learning Python
The purpose is for offensive scripting, not applications builds

Starting with some basic, foundational knowledge but with a targeted end goal. It seemed to help me digest the vastness of learning a language without having to brute force memorization of definitions, syntax etc. 

Learn with small, targeted applications

Thanks!
